/*
 * Online play, first step: two copies of the game kept in step by exchanging the pads' input (branch netplay).
 *
 * Both copies run the same game from the first vertical blank on. Each has ONE local player (the host is player 1,
 * the one who joins player 2); at every vertical blank a copy sends its player's input for that blank to the other
 * and does not go on before it has the other's input for it ("lockstep"). The game then reads the two pads from
 * here on both machines, so both simulate the same thing. Nothing is predicted and nothing is rewound yet: a slow
 * connection makes both games wait. Rewinding (port/src/gs/state.c) comes on top of this.
 *
 *   BT3_NET_HOST=<port>             wait for the other copy on this UDP port, be player 1
 *   BT3_NET_JOIN=<address>:<port>   connect to a host, be player 2
 *   BT3_NET_DELAY=<n>               a player's input takes effect n blanks after it was made (default 2): the time
 *                                   the other side has to receive it without the game having to wait
 *   BT3_NET_SCRIPT=<file>           testing: the local player's input comes from a table (36 bytes per blank: pad
 *                                   1, pad 2; written by BT3_PAD_TABLE=<file> during an ordinary run), not from
 *                                   the keyboard or a controller
 *   BT3_NET_LOSS=<percent>, BT3_NET_LAG=<ms>   testing: drop that share of the packets sent / hold each one back
 *   BT3_VIEW=0|1                    testing: show that player's view full screen in a two-player battle (what a
 *                                   connected copy does with its own player's)
 *
 * A packet carries the sender's input for the last 16 blanks, so a lost packet is covered by the next ones; while
 * a copy waits it sends its own latest packet again every few milliseconds.

 * The session started from the game's "Dragon Net Battle" entry.

 * Two copies can only stay in step if they start from the same state, and two players coming from their own menus
 * with their own saves are not in the same state. So a session is a fresh start of the program on both sides:
 *   1. the lobby (the window behind the menu entry): one side hosts, the other joins; the two find each other
 *      (Port_Lobby*, a greeting and its answer);
 *   2. each side then starts the program again with BT3_NET_SESSION=1 and its role, an empty save folder of the
 *      session's own (net_session/), and connects again as above. The game boots without picture and sound and
 *      not held to real time, straight into the versus mode's menu (headless.c), with everything unlocked by the
 *      game's own Save_UnlockAll, so both sides have the same roster;
 *   3. from there it is the game's own two-player versus mode, the host's pad also driving the menus;
 *   4. leaving the versus mode for the main menu ends the session: each side starts the program once more, as
 *      it normally is, with its own save.
